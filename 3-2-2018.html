<h2> 3.2.2018 </h2>
<p> 4.00am I dared myself to check on my midterm grades.
I'm still to this date relatively afraid of receiving a bad grade.
I still think of the future and the repercussions in may bring. 
However, at this point I've improved how I respond to checking my grades.
I'm torn between checking and not checking them. If it didn't really matter,
I wouldn't be so scared to check on them. However, deep down inside I know that
I'm still fearful and sick and it may be a better idea to just leave it alone.
Being more reflective of my thoughts and physical responses, I tried to set the
correct mindset first before checking on them. I've had similar experiences before
where I wasn't mentally prepared, and the bad grades hit me like a storm and I went 
dormant for a few days (procrastinated and stuff). I had to be wary this time.

<p>God is always in control. Believe that whatever calamity you think you are experiencing, 
is actually a blessing in disguise. We simply have to change our perspective and look
through God's eyes. Are we sure that what we want is aligned with what God wants?
