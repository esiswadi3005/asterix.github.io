<h1> Last KOR50 Lecture </h1>
<p> Today was the last KOR50 lecture, and we talked about the very near history to the present including
the internet, the metoo movement etc. However, today was special because it was honestly the first time in my life
that I've ever witnessed students (me included) giving a round of applause for the teacher after a lecture. 
<ul>
<li> He talked about how we percieve the past affect how we percieve the future. 
</li><li> We are a part of history no matter what.
</li></li> We learn that the little things we do now, even if it might seem like a failure (March 1st movement)
may have a huge impact in the future.
</li><li> He gave a phrase that sounded awesome questioning what we want to do as our actions now are important
</li></ul>
<br> Then it just felt like an applause moment</p>
<p> I honestly really enjoyed this class. It totally changed my perspective towards History. 
Ive always percieved it as boring and full of memorization. However, if you look at it as your
people's story (struggles, achievements, battles, movements) it really is something else.
I think knowing history is really beneficial especially for government officials who
make the most important decisions. It really lets us help understand one another and avoid
misunderstandings and regrettable conflicts in the future. My perspective towards North Korea
changed from the perspective and rhetoric CNN and many youtube channels have designed.
