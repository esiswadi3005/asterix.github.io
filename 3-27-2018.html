<h1> Grades again.. </h1>

So I'm finished with my finals and the grades came out for my Math stats course. <br>
I guess it was dissapointing because I felt that I was able to do the final exam. <br>
I'm really sure that I did okay, but turns out I was way below the average and it somehow didn't make sense <br>
However, the point is I shouldn't be arguing but rather realize that there is a God and something more <br>
powerful at play. God loves me and that's all that matters. He could've very easily given me a perfect score <br>
and straight A's but I wouldn't be learning shit about Him or my life. <br>
I'm sure that he is preparing me for something bigger and this is exercise. <br>
TBH, UCLA means nothing to me, it's just that it's annoying because it's important for everyone else <br>
I also learnt that effort doesn't equate results. Another good argument to how in control He is.<br>
You can work your ass off and slave, but if it's not according to His will, you bet ur ass it won't happen. <br>

There's this pressure somewhere that I should be someone significant because people say it's "possible". <br>
I think the notion that everybody can do anything is pressuring the hell out of me and I'm sure many others <br>
Meritocracy is bullshit <br>
Denzel said "Everything you think I've achieved, and everything you think I have is by God's grace" <br>
<br>

This event has caused me to worry about a few more things <br>
There is now an even bigger chance for me to fail my class and retake it in the future <br>
Realistically, I should be fine with that event happening. Why? <br>
Because whatever I think I deserve should go down the frkin drain real quick <br>
I'm nothing but God's faithful and humble servant <br>
Whatever happens, it is God directing me to a path I'm excited to venture. <br>
<br>
Let me ride this rollercoaster and expose me of my weaknesses and my strengths as well. <br>
I'm a Christian, society's construct of success and especially failure should have a <br>
completely different meaning in my dictionary.

<br><br>
Failure should probably be losing faith. What am I left with without faith? nothing.
