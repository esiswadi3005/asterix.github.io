<h2> 3.3.2018 </h2>
<p> Today I checked my maths grade and received good results. The feeling was pretty great,
similar to how I felt when I was in GRC. Time to be reflective again.
If grades don't matter, then the response towards good grades should also be appropriate.
<b>Alhamdulillah</b> - praise be to God alone. In times like this it's important to say
Alhamdulillah. More of You and less of me. Thank you God for all your blessings.
Help me to always remember that in both good times and bad, I am your <b>humble</b> and <b>faithful</b> servant.
<p> P.S. I also went to LACMA alone for KOR50 lol. It was pretty fun. Felt like an explorer. 
It was also a cold and wet day in LA. It reminded me of Washington's awesome soothing weather. I got free admission but the parking was expensive as shit </p>
