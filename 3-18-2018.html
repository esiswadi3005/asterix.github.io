<h1> Losing myself </h1>
<p> I wonder what it feels like to lose one's self.
<br> I wonder if that's what I'm feeling right now. <br>
Sure, my life now here is different. I don't get to talk to people no more.
I constantly wonder if all this time spent alone is worth it. </p>
<p> I feel like I'm going away little by little.
I think I was proud of who I was (it could also simply be a made up memory)
I was able to do this and that. Never have I thought that I would be this physically weak.
My body is crying... I've been beating it up pretty badly. 
I sit more than I stand, spend more time on than off the screen.
Is this humane?
I've always been proud of my leadership and interpersonal skills.
It's been over a year now, truly out of touch with the world, out of touch with people
Under 50 words per day? Is this humane? Am I not going crazy?
Last night 3-17, I saw a homeless guy on the street talking to himself out loud without
a care in the world. All I could think about if I were in his shoes is the other people
staring and judging. As I'm working on trying to not give a rats ass on what other people think
I became impressed on what I assumed was a skill he acquired (he def didn't care).
But then, as my mind continued to wander, was it really a skill he acquired or a 
survival response to isolation? A last desperate measure to stay somewhat sane in a world
so cruel and fearful. Therefore, naturally I wonder whether I'm becoming him.
Does it not make sense that if I don't have anyone to talk to, that I inevtably start 
talking much more to myself? Is it ok to fear this?
Is this simply a "different" me or a transformation to something dangerously irreversible.
On the surface, I don't think that this is a sin. However, I've become extremely detached
and useless to the people around me that it just might be a sin.
I know that uni is important, and I do want to believe that this is my path and that I'm serving God.
A lot of people doesn't seem to really care (or at least not vocal about it) that their uni is for God or not.
If they do, WHY are they not vocal about it? Why is it that everytime I bring it up in conversation I see
faces who cannot seem to relate? It's such a hard task for me, so why is it not for others? What am I missing here?

One thing that I've yet to realize is that deviating from society is probably one of the HARDEST
things I have to do. Learning from others, trying to find the answer in others, 
trying to find motivation from others, competing in the same realm with the same purpose as others
has rendered it extremely difficult to deviate. I'm just glad my gf claims to understand this.
I pray that if the time comes, she will understand and support. 

After writing for 30 minutes, I realize that the above is extremely sad, gloomy and ultimately
disorganized to the point that its become unreadable.

However, this is somewhat of an accurate portrait of my sad, confused and disorganized life.
My life is for Jesus, and I will standby this till the end of my days.
If this is what I have to go through, so be it.
If this is what I'm going to be, so be it. 
I shouldn't have any expectations for myself as it will inhibit your molding of me. 
Teach me to be more mindful of my body
Teach me to be fearless

I am your humble servant.. and he needs Your help.
